# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

##
To build this application we need this packages 
1.axios :for fetching data from api 
2.moment : library working with time and date 
3.react-file-base64: will use to upload the files(images) will convert them into
base64 formate (binary formate)
4.redux :
5.redux-thunk :used to handle the async actions using redux 

folder structure 
in src=>components
Form and Posts 
in Form =>Form.js and styles.js 
in Posts =>Posts.ja and styles.js 

in Posts another folder such as Post=>Post.js and style.js 
in App.js 
import {Container,AppBar,Grow,Grid,Typography } from '@material-ui/core;
Typography : basic styling to h2 p 
it gives standard look for form 

add styles to eacj post ,posts and form 
Now need to connect this to backend and connecting db 
For that need to create one folder api 
then create file called index.js 
import axios there 
to make api call 

const url = 'http://localhost:5000/posts';
to hit backend server 
export const fetchPosts = ()=>axios.get(url);
Here we use Redux capabilities when there is actions towrs to backend 
and dispatch those actions 
1.actions 
2.reducers folders created
